I'm currently a [last year] PhD student with *Center for Applied Intelligent Systems Research* ([CAISR](http://hh.se/english/schoolofinformationtechnology/research/caisrcenterforappliedintelligentsystemsresearch.11375.html)) at [Halmstad University](http://hh.se/english.5_en.html).
My research interests are Computer Vision, Machine learning, and autonomous mobile robot applications.
My PhD has been focused on developing methods to enable autonomous robots to better interpret and understand their internal maps.
I have been partly involved in the *Automatic Inventory and Mapping of Stock* project ([AIMS](http://islab.hh.se/mediawiki/index.php/AIMS), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLs8WH3dbGM)), and my licentiate dissertation is written on *Semantic Mapping in Warehouses* as a part of the AIMS project.

<!-- Some parts of my PhD research is accessible through these repositories: -->
<!-- * [Arrangement](https://github.com/saeedghsh/arrangement) -->
<!-- * [2D Map Alignment](https://github.com/saeedghsh/Map-Alignment-2D) -->
<!-- * [Place Categorization](https://github.com/saeedghsh/Place-Categorization-2D) -->
<!-- * [Halmstad Maps](https://github.com/saeedghsh/Halmstad-Robot-Maps) -->

Besides, as an amateur,
I am very interested in DIY projects that involves embedded systems or programing,
and
I very much enjoy reading ([GR](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18867219-saeed)), rock climing and photography ([IG](https://www.instagram.com/saeedghsh/), [500px](https://500px.com/saeedghsh)).
